## why do i build jekyll-podcast

uploading podcasts is not as easy as uploading videos, you have to own or borrow a web server to host your content.

there are a lot of platforms for people to upload podcasts, but some of them spend your money, some of them cannot be configured to your requirement.

although there are also some podcast holding solutions for jekyll, they are difficult to use. and they don't have a solution to generate web pages for your podcast.

to solve these problems, i build this configurable jekyll-podcast. you can host it on [github](http://github.com) for free, so you can buy you a better ðŸŽ™ microphone.

## how to use
